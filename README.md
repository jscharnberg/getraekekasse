# Club Inventory System

The Club Inventory System is a software solution designed specifically for clubs such as volunteer fire departments, aiming to simplify inventory management and billing through individual user accounts.

## Features

- **Inventory Management:** Capture, update, and track your club's inventory using a user-friendly interface.

- **User Accounts:** Each user has their own account, allowing them to access the system and manage inventory data.

- **Billing:** The software facilitates the creation of invoices through user accounts, tracking financial transactions related to inventory.

- **User Privileges:**
  - **Admins:** Administrators have the ability to manage the entire system, including user accounts, inventory, and financial transactions.
  - **Users:** Regular users can access a page where they can deduct the cost of items, such as drinks, from their account balance. This action also reflects in the inventory.
